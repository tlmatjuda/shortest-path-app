description: Kubernetes HELM app-charts for the shortest path app

# A app-charts can be either an 'application' or a 'library' app-charts.
#
# Application app-charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library app-charts provide useful utilities or functions for the app-charts developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application app-charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library app-charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the app-charts version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the app-charts and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
